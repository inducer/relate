Installation
============

RELATE requires Python 3.

Installation for Relate Development
-----------------------------------

Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`__ and NPM.

Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`__ to manage dependencies and virtual
environments::

    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

Note that this will put poetry in ``$HOME/.poetry/bin`` and modify your
``$HOME/.profile``. If you don't like that, see the
`poetry docs <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`__ for alternate installation options.

To install, clone the repository and enter it::

    git clone https://github.com/inducer/relate.git
    cd relate

Install the dependencies. Poetry will automatically create a virtualenv
(somewhere under ``$HOME/.poetry``) for this::

    poetry install

If this installation step encounters hangs or errors that implicate access to a
keyring, setting a keyring backend may help::

    export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.fail.Keyring

Activate the virtual environment::

    poetry shell

Copy (and, optionally, edit) the example configuration::

    cp local_settings_example.py local_settings.py
    $EDITOR local_settings.py

Initialize the database::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser --username=$(whoami)

Retrieve frontend (JS/CSS) dependencies and build::

    npm install
    npm run build

Run the server::

    python manage.py runserver

Open a browser to http://localhost:8000, sign in (your user name will be the
same as your system user name, or whatever ``whoami`` returned above) and select
"Set up new course".

As you play with the web interface, you may notice that some long-running tasks
just sit there: That is because RELATE relies on a task queue to process
those long-running tasks. Start a worker by running::

    celery worker -A relate

.. note::

    For Windows, you need first install `gevent` by::

        pip install gevent

    and then run::

        celery worker -A relate -P gevent

    See the `related issue <https://stackoverflow.com/a/47331438/3437454>`_ for more information.

To make this work, you also need a message broker running. This uses the
setting ``CELERY_BROKER_URL`` in ``local_settings.py`` and defaults to
``'amqp://'``.  With that setting, you need for example `RabbitMQ
<https://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_ or another implementation installed.  On
Debian-like Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), the following should suffice::

    apt-get install rabbitmq-server

.. note::

    To install RabbitMQ for Windows, see `Installing on Windows
    <https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html>`_ for more information.

See the `Celery documentation
<http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std:setting-broker_url>`_
for more information on alternate brokers and settings.

Note that, due to limitations of the demo configuration (i.e. due to not having
out-of-process caches available), long-running tasks can only show
"PENDING/STARTED/SUCCESS/FAILURE" as their progress, but no more detailed
information. This will be better as soon as you provide actual caches (the "CACHES"
option :file:`local_settings.py`).


Additional setup steps for Docker
---------------------------------

To allow running code questions, install docker and give Relate access. The simplest
way to do so is (on a Debian/Ubuntu system)::

    apt install docker.io

Then add the user that runs Relate to the ``docker`` group in
:file:`/etc/group`.  For deployment, this may be the ``www-data`` user.
You should also pull the default container image::

    docker pull inducer/relate-runpy-amd64

Add to kernel command line, if needed::

    [...] cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1

Change docker config to disallow IP forwarding::

    --ip-forward=false

in :file:`/etc/default/docker.io`.

If you need more scalable code execution, consider Docker Swarm.

Long-term maintenance
---------------------

As course content gets updated repeatedly, more and more little files get
created in the directories containing the course directories. Given enough
time, RELATE may eventually encounter this `issue in dulwich
<https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich/issues/281>`_, the software component that
RELATE uses to access git repositories. If it does, it will fail with
``IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files``.

To prevent this from happening, it is advisable to occasionally run ``git repack -a -d``
on RELATE's git repositories. This may be accomplished by creating a
`Cron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_ job running
a customized version of
`this script <https://github.com/inducer/relate/blob/master/repack-repositories.sh>`_.
This is needed about once every few hundred course update cycles, so relatively
infrequently.

Setting up SAML2
----------------

- Install ``xmlsec1``.

- Flip ``RELATE_SIGN_IN_BY_SAML2_ENABLED`` to ``True``.

- Edit :file:`saml_config.py` using :file:`saml_config.py.example`
  as a guide.

Setting up Social Authentication (Google as an example)
-------------------------------------------------------

- Go to the `Google Developer Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`__.
- Create a project.
- Create an OAuth consent screen. You'll only need the ``.../auth/userinfo.email``
  and ``.../auth/userinfo.profile`` scopes.
- Under "Credentials", create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Enter your equivalent of
  ``https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/social-auth/complete/google-oauth2/`` as
  an authorized redirect URI. For testing, you can also add
  ``http://localhost:8000/social-auth/complete/google-oauth2/``.
  You do not need any authorized JavaScript origins.
- Add ``"social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2"`` to
  ``RELATE_SOCIAL_AUTH_BACKENDS``.
- Copy the Client ID into ``SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY``, and the
  Client Secret from the developer console into ``SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET``.
- Restart your server. You should be good to go.

Deployment
----------

The following assumes you are using systemd on your deployment system.

Additional Setup Steps for Deploying to Production
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Install nginx for reverse proxying and uwsgi to run the app server. See below
    for configuration.
*   Use postgres as a database. You need to create a user and a database that relate
    will use and enter the details (database name, user name, password) into
    :file:`local_settings.py`. You will also need to::

        poetry install -E postgres

*   The directory specified under ``GIT_ROOT`` must be owned by the user
    running Relate.

*   Run::

        ./collectstatic.sh

    to assemble the required collection of static files to be served, as the
    production app server will not serve them (unlike the dev server).

    (Do not run ``python manage.py collectstatic`` directly; it will fail
    because it cannot resolve some source map URLs in mathjax.)

Configuring uwsgi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following should be in :file:`/etc/uwsgi/apps-available/relate.ini`::

    [uwsgi]
    plugins = python
    # or plugins = python3
    socket = /tmp/uwsgi-relate.sock
    chdir=/home/andreas/relate
    virtualenv=/home/andreas/my-relate-env
    module=relate.wsgi:application
    need-app = 1
    reload-mercy=8
    max-requests=300
    workers=8
    autoload=false

Then run::

    # cd /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled
    # ln -s ../apps-available/relate.ini
    # service uwsgi restart

Configuring nginx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adapt the following snippet to serve as part of your `nginx
<http://nginx.org>`_ configuration::

    server {
      listen *:80;
      listen [::]:80;
      server_name relate.cs.illinois.edu;

      rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;  # enforce https

      add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    }

    server {
      listen *:443 ssl;
      listen [::]:443 ssl;

      ssl_certificate /etc/certs/2015-01/relate-combined.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/2015-01/relate.key;

      client_max_body_size 100M;

      location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_read_timeout 300;
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/uwsgi-relate.sock;
      }
      location /static {
        alias /home/andreas/relate/static;
      }
      location /media {
        alias /home/andreas/relate/media;
      }

      add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    }


Starting the message queue workers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a variant of this as :file:`/etc/systemd/system/relate-celery.service`::

    [Unit]
    Description=Celery workers for RELATE
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data

    WorkingDirectory=/home/andreas/relate

    PermissionsStartOnly=true
    ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /var/run/celery
    ExecStartPre=/bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/run/celery/

    ExecStart=/home/andreas/my-relate-env/bin/celery -A relate multi start worker \
        --pidfile=/var/run/celery/celery.pid \
        --logfile=/var/log/celery/celery.log --loglevel="INFO"
    ExecStop=/home/andreas/my-relate-env/bin/celery multi stopwait worker \
        --pidfile=/var/run/celery/celery.pid

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Create the directories :file:`/var/run/celery` and :file:`/var/log/celery` and
give ownership to ``www-data``::

    # mkdir /var/{run,log}/celery
    # chown www-data.www-data /var/{run,log}/celery

Then run::

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl start relate-celery.service
    # systemctl status relate-celery.service
    # systemctl enable relate-celery.service

Minimal Install for Validating Course Content
---------------------------------------------

Install poetry::

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3 -

See the `Poetry documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`__ for other options.

Then, download relate::

    git clone https://github.com/inducer/relate.git
    cd relate

Poetry creates virtualenvs in your home directory by default. Create a file ``poetry.toml``
with the following contents::

    [virtualenvs]
    in-project = true

Next, install Relate and its dependencies::

    poetry install

In order to use the ``relate`` command, you need to activate the virtualenv that
was created::

    source ~/path/to/relate/checkout/.venv/bin/activate

Enabling I18n support/Translating RELATE into other Languages
=============================================================

Creating New Translations
-------------------------

RELATE is translatable into languages other than English. Run the
following command::

    django-admin makemessages -l de

This will generate a message file for German, where the locale name ``de``
stands for Germany. The message file located in the ``locale`` directory
of your RELATE installation. For example, the above command will generate
a message file ``django.po`` in ``/project/root/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES``.

Edit ``django.po``. For each ``msgid`` string, put it's translation in
``msgstr`` right below. ``msgctxt`` strings, along with the commented
``Translators:`` strings above some ``msgid`` strings, are used to provide
more information for better understanding of the text to be translated.
A Simplified Chinese version (demo) of translation is included for Chinese
users, with locale name ``zh_HANS``.

Enabling Translations
---------------------

When translations are done, run the following command in root directory::

    django-admin compilemessages -l de

Your translations are ready for use. If you translate RELATE, please submit
your translations for inclusion into the RELATE itself.

To enable the translations, open your ``local_settings.py``, uncomment the
``LANGUAGE_CODE`` string and change 'en-us' to the locale name of your
language.

For more instructions, please refer to `Localization: how to create
language files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_.

.. _cli:

Installing the Command Line Interface
-------------------------------------

RELATE validation (and a number of other functionalities) are also via the
:command:`relate` command. This may be installed as follows.

Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`__ to manage dependencies and virtual
environments::

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3

Clone the relate repository and enter it::

    git clone https://github.com/inducer/relate.git
    cd relate

Create a file ``poetry.toml`` containing the lines::

    [virtualenvs]
    in-project = true

and running::

    poetry install --no-dev

in the root directory of the RELATE distribution. The ``relate`` command is
then available at ``relate/.venv/bin/relate`` and can be used in a course
repository by running::

    relate validate .

A number of additional functionalities (such as ``relate test-code``) are
also available from the ``relate`` command.

User-visible Changes
====================

Version 2022.1
--------------

* In March 2022 (specifically, with
  `this pull request <https://github.com/inducer/relate/pull/892>`__),
  Relate adopted Bootstrap 5, which brought with it some changes that might
  affect courses that relied on CSS or other markup features specific to
  Bootstrap 3. For comprehensive advice on how to port your content to
  the upgraded CSS framework, see the `official porting guide
  <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/migration/>`__.  Here are some specific
  tips on migrating your course content that may suffice for simple cases:

  * The CSS class ``btn-default`` was removed. Use ``btn-secondary`` instead.
    Potentially consider the new ``btn-outline-{primary,secondary}``.

  * If you have collapsing panels in your course content, you may use markup
    like the following instead:

    .. code:: html

        <div class="card mb-3" markdown="block">
          <div class="card-header">
            <h5 class="card-title dropdown-toggle">
              <a class="text-decoration-none link-secondary"
                data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#starter-code" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="starter-code">
                  Header
              </a>
            </h5>
          </div>
          <div id="starter-code" class="collapse">
           <div class="card-body">
             Content
           </div>
          </div>
        </div>

    If you are looking for an updated version of the ``collapsible`` macro from
    the sample content, you may find it `here
    <https://github.com/inducer/relate-sample/blob/0a7019584fda7ea0b91cc3fd370b799df249460a/content-macros.jinja#L18-L34>`__.

  * Relate has also dropped "Font Awesome" (which is no longer maintained in
    open-source form) in favor of `Bootstrap Icons
    <https://icons.getbootstrap.com/>`__, which provides a similar icons with a
    look consistent with Bootstrap. In many cases, all that is required is
    to switch ``fa fa-key`` CSS classes to ``bi bi-key`` (or similar).
    See the full list of available icons `here <https://icons.getbootstrap.com/>`__.

* Relate can now automatically compute point counts/percentages from
  human-provided feedback. See :ref:`points-from-feedback`.
