Installation
============

RELATE requires Python 3.

Minimal Install for Validating Course Content
---------------------------------------------

Make a virtualenv, install poetry and relate::

    python3 -m venv my-relate-venv
    source my-relate-venv/bin/activate
    pip install poetry
    git clone https://github.com/inducer/relate.git
    cd relate
    poetry install

After this, you can delete the ``relate`` git checkout created. In order to
use the ``relate`` comand, you need to activate the virtualenv that was created::

    source my-relate-venv/bin/activate

Installation for Relate Development
-----------------------------------

Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`__ and NPM, or `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com>`__
(version 1, an alternative package manager) at your option.

Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`__ to manage dependencies and virtual
environments::

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3

Note that this will put poetry in ``$HOME/.poetry/bin`` and modify your
``$HOME/.profile``. If you don't like that, see the
`poetry docs <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`__ for alternate installation options.

To install, clone the repository::

    git clone git://github.com/inducer/relate

Enter the relate directory::

    cd relate

Install the dependencies. Poetry will automatically create a virtualenv
(somewhere under ``$HOME/.poetry``) for this:

    poetry install

Activate the virtual environment::

    poetry shell

Copy (and, optionally, edit) the example configuration::

    cp local_settings_example.py local_settings.py
    $EDITOR local_settings.py

Initialize the database::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser --username=$(whoami)

Retrieve static (JS/CSS) dependencies::

    npm install

or::

    yarn

Run the server::

    python manage.py runserver

Open a browser to http://localhost:8000, sign in (your user name will be the
same as your system user name, or whatever ``whoami`` returned above) and select
"Set up new course".

As you play with the web interface, you may notice that some long-running tasks
just sit there: That is because RELATE relies on a task queue to process
those long-running tasks. Start a worker by running::

    celery worker -A relate

.. note::

    For Windows, you need first install `gevent` by::

        pip install gevent

    and then run::

        celery worker -A relate -P gevent

    See the `related issue <https://stackoverflow.com/a/47331438/3437454>`_ for more information.

To make this work, you also need a message broker running. This uses the
setting ``CELERY_BROKER_URL`` in ``local_settings.py`` and defaults to
``'amqp://'``.  With that setting, you need for example `RabbitMQ
<https://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_ or another implementation installed.  On
Debian-like Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), the following should suffice::

    apt-get install rabbitmq-server

.. note::

    To install RabbitMQ for Windows, see `Installing on Windows
    <https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html>`_ for more information.

See the `Celery documentation
<http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std:setting-broker_url>`_
for more information on alternate brokers and settings.

Note that, due to limitations of the demo configuration (i.e. due to not having
out-of-process caches available), long-running tasks can only show
"PENDING/STARTED/SUCCESS/FAILURE" as their progress, but no more detailed
information. This will be better as soon as you provide actual caches (the "CACHES"
option :file:`local_settings.py`).


Additional setup steps for Docker
---------------------------------

To allow running code questions, install docker and give Relate access. The simplest
way to do so is (on a Debian/Ubuntu system)::

    apt install docker.io

Then add the user that runs Relate to the ``docker`` group in
:file:`/etc/group`.  For deployment, this may be the ``www-data`` user.
You should also pull the default container image::

    docker pull inducer/relate-runpy-amd64

Add to kernel command line, if needed::

    [...] cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1

Change docker config to disallow IP forwarding::

    --ip-forward=false

in :file:`/etc/default/docker.io`.

If you need more scalable code execution, consider Docker Swarm.

Long-term maintenance
---------------------

As course content gets updated repeatedly, more and more little files get
created in the directories containing the course directories. Given enough
time, RELATE may eventually encounter this `issue in dulwich
<https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich/issues/281>`_, the software component that
RELATE uses to access git repositories. If it does, it will fail with
``IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files``.

To prevent this from happening, it is advisable to occasionally run ``git repack -a -d``
on RELATE's git repositories. This may be accomplished by creating a
`Cron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_ job running
a customized version of
`this script <https://github.com/inducer/relate/blob/master/repack-repositories.sh>`_.
This is needed about once every few hundred course update cycles, so relatively
infrequently.

Setting up SAML2
----------------

- Install ``xmlsec1``.

- Flip ``RELATE_SIGN_IN_BY_SAML2_ENABLED`` to ``True``.

- Edit :file:`saml_config.py` using :file:`saml_config.py.example`
  as a guide.

Setting up Social Authentication (Google as an example)
-------------------------------------------------------

- Go to the `Google Developer Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`__.
- Create a project.
- Create an OAuth consent screen. You'll only need the ``.../auth/userinfo.email``
  and ``.../auth/userinfo.profile`` scopes.
- Under "Credentials", create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Enter your equivalent of
  ``https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/social-auth/complete/google-oauth2/`` as
  an authorized redirect URI. For testing, you can also add
  ``http://localhost:8000/social-auth/complete/google-oauth2/``.
  You do not need any authorized JavaScript origins.
- Add ``"social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2"`` to
  ``RELATE_SOCIAL_AUTH_BACKENDS``.
- Copy the Client ID into ``SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY``, and the
  Client Secret from the developer console into ``SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET``.
- Restart your server. You should be good to go.

Deployment
----------

The following assumes you are using systemd on your deployment system.

Additional Setup Steps for Deploying to Production
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Install nginx for reverse proxying and uwsgi to run the app server. See below
    for configuration.
*   Use postgres as a database. You need to create a user and a database that relate
    will use and enter the details (database name, user name, password) into
    :file:`local_settings.py`. You will also need to::

        pip install psycopg2

*   The directory specified under ``GIT_ROOT`` must be owned by the user
    running Relate.

*   Run::

        python manage.py collectstatic

    to assemble the required collection of static files to be served, as the
    production app server will not serve them (unlike the dev server).

Configuring uwsgi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following should be in :file:`/etc/uwsgi/apps-available/relate.ini`::

    [uwsgi]
    plugins = python
    # or plugins = python3
    socket = /tmp/uwsgi-relate.sock
    chdir=/home/andreas/relate
    virtualenv=/home/andreas/my-relate-env
    module=relate.wsgi:application
    need-app = 1
    reload-mercy=8
    max-requests=300
    workers=8
    autoload=false

Then run::

    # cd /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled
    # ln -s ../apps-available/relate.ini
    # service uwsgi restart

Configuring nginx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adapt the following snippet to serve as part of your `nginx
<http://nginx.org>`_ configuration::

    server {
      listen *:80;
      listen [::]:80;
      server_name relate.cs.illinois.edu;

      rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;  # enforce https

      add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    }

    server {
      listen *:443 ssl;
      listen [::]:443 ssl;

      ssl_certificate /etc/certs/2015-01/relate-combined.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/2015-01/relate.key;

      client_max_body_size 100M;

      location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_read_timeout 300;
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/uwsgi-relate.sock;
      }
      location /static {
        alias /home/andreas/relate/static;
      }
      location /media {
        alias /home/andreas/relate/media;
      }

      add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    }


Starting the message queue workers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a variant of this as :file:`/etc/systemd/system/relate-celery.service`::

    [Unit]
    Description=Celery workers for RELATE
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data

    WorkingDirectory=/home/andreas/relate

    PermissionsStartOnly=true
    ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /var/run/celery
    ExecStartPre=/bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/run/celery/

    ExecStart=/home/andreas/my-relate-env/bin/celery multi start worker \
        -A relate --pidfile=/var/run/celery/celery.pid \
        --logfile=/var/log/celery/celery.log --loglevel="INFO"
    ExecStop=/home/andreas/my-relate-env/bin/celery multi stopwait worker \
        --pidfile=/var/run/celery/celery.pid

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Create the directories :file:`/var/run/celery` and :file:`/var/log/celery` and
give ownership to ``www-data``::

    # mkdir /var/{run,log}/celery
    # chown www-data.www-data /var/{run,log}/celery

Then run::

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl start relate-celery.service
    # systemctl status relate-celery.service
    # systemctl enable relate-celery.service

Enabling I18n support/Translating RELATE into other Languages
=============================================================

Creating New Translations
-------------------------

RELATE is translatable into languages other than English. Run the
following command::

    django-admin makemessages -l de

This will generate a message file for German, where the locale name ``de``
stands for Germany. The message file located in the ``locale`` directory
of your RELATE installation. For example, the above command will generate
a message file ``django.po`` in ``/project/root/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES``.

Edit ``django.po``. For each ``msgid`` string, put it's translation in
``msgstr`` right below. ``msgctxt`` strings, along with the commented
``Translators:`` strings above some ``msgid`` strings, are used to provide
more information for better understanding of the text to be translated.
A Simplified Chinese version (demo) of translation is included for Chinese
users, with locale name ``zh_HANS``.

Enabling Translations
---------------------

When translations are done, run the following command in root directory::

    django-admin compilemessages -l de

Your translations are ready for use. If you translate RELATE, please submit
your translations for inclusion into the RELATE itself.

To enable the translations, open your ``local_settings.py``, uncomment the
``LANGUAGE_CODE`` string and change 'en-us' to the locale name of your
language.

For more instructions, please refer to `Localization: how to create
language files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_.
