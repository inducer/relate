Welcome to CourseFlow's documentation!
======================================

    *"I just want to ask my students some quiz questions online. How hard could it
    possibly be?"*

CourseFlow is a `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_-based courseware
package that lets students participate in online activities. Each such activity
is called a "flow". It flows over a couple of pages, each of which can be, say,
a video, a quiz question, a page of text, or, within the confines of HTML,
something completely different.
