Flows
=====

.. currentmodule:: course.constants

All interactive content in RELATE is part of a *flow*. Relate uses the made-up
word "flow" to denote an interactive experience that can be any of the
following:

* A quiz
* A few pages of introductory text, combined with some videos
* An exam
* A long-form homework assignment

And possibly many more different things. Technically, a flow consists of
multiple webpages, each of which may allow the participant some type of
interaction, such as submitting answers to questions. All interactions of the
participant with a flow constitute a session. A participant may have multiple
sessions per flow, corresponding to, for example, being able to take the same
quiz multiple times.

This chapter describes how flows are defined from the instructor's perspective.
This consists of two main parts. The first part is defining the interactions
themselves, by providing content for the flow pages. The second consists of
describing what participants are allowed to do, and what grades they are to
receive for their interactions. The system allows tremendous latitude in
defining these rules.

Things that can be decided by flow rules include the following:

* Is student allowed only one or multiple sessions?
* Is the student allowed to review past sessions?
* What are the deadlines involved and how much credit is received for completing a flow?
* Is a participant shown the correct answer and/or the correctness of their
  answer? When are they shown this information? (Right after they submit their
  answer or only after the deadline passes or perhaps right after they have
  submitted their work for grading?)

Overall Structure of a Flow
---------------------------

When described in YAML, a flow has the following components:

.. currentmodule:: course.content

.. autoclass:: FlowDesc

.. _flow-rules:

Flow rules
----------

An Example
^^^^^^^^^^

Here's a commented example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:
        # Rules that govern when a new session may be started and whether
        # existing sessions may be listed.

        start:
        -
            # Members of the listed roles may start a new session of this
            # flow if they have fewer than 2 existing sessions if the current
            # time is before the event 'end_week 1'.

            if_before: end_week 1
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 2
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            # Otherwise, no new sessions will be allowed,
            # but existing ones may be listed.

            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        # Rules that govern what a user may do with an existing session.
        access:
        -
             # Before the event 'end_week 2', a user may view, submit answers
             # to the flow, and see the grade they received for their answers.

             if_before: end_week 2
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness]

        -
             # Afterwards, they will also be allowed to see the correct answer.
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness, see_answer_after_submission]

        # Rules that govern how (permanent) grades are generated from the
        # results of a flow.

        # Grades for this flow are recorded under grade identifier 'la_quiz'.
        # Multiple such grades (if present) are aggregated by taking their maximum.

        grade_identifier: la_quiz
        grade_aggregation_strategy: max_grade

        grading:
        -
            # If the user completes the flow before the event 'end_week 1', they
            # receive full credit.

            if_completed_before: end_week 1
            credit_percent: 100

        -
            # Otherwise, no credit is given.
            credit_percent: 0

.. autoclass:: grade_aggregation_strategy

.. _flow-page:

Flow pages
----------

.. _flow-groups:

Grouping
^^^^^^^^

Each flow consists of a number of page groups, each of which is made up of
individual :ref:`flow-page`.

The purpose of page groups is to allow shuffling and random selection of
some subset of pages. For example, this functionality would allow you to
have a flow consisting of:

* a fixed introduction page (that is always at the beginning)

* a group of exam questions randomly selected from a bigger pool

* a fixed final page (that may ask the student to, say, affirm academic
  honesty)

Each of these would be a separate 'group'.

Each group allows the following attributes:

.. currentmodule:: course.content

.. autoclass:: FlowPageGroupDesc

.. _page-permissions:

Per-page permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The granted access permissions for the entire flow (see
:class:`~course.content.FlowSessionAccessRuleDesc`) can be modified on a
per-page basis.  This happens in the ``access_rules`` sub-block of each page,
e.g. in :attr:`course.page.ChoiceQuestion.access_rules`:

.. class:: PageAccessRules

    .. attribute:: add_permissions

        A list of :class:`~course.constants.flow_permission` values that are
        granted *in addition* to the globally granted ones.

    .. attribute:: remove_permissions

        A list of :class:`~course.constants.flow_permission` values that are
        not granted for this page even if they are granted by the global flow
        permissions.

For example, to grant permission to revise an answer on a
:class:`course.page.PythonCodeQuestion`, one might type::

    type: PythonCodeQuestion
    id: addition
    access_rules:
        add_permissions:
            - change_answer
    value: 1

.. _flow-life-cycle:

Life cycle
----------

.. currentmodule:: course.constants

.. autoclass:: flow_session_expiration_mode

Sample Rule Sets
----------------

RELATE's rule system is quite flexible and allows many different styles
of interaction. Some of what's possible may not be readily apparent
from the reference documentation above, so the following examples
serve to illustrate the possibilities.

Simple Single-Submission Assignment with a Due Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "An assignment"
    description: |

        # An Assignment

    rules:
        start:
        -
            if_before: my_assignment_due
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 1
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        access:
        -
            # 'modify'-type permissions are automatically removed at
            # session end. Add the following if desired:
            #
            # see_correctness
            # change_answer
            #
            permissions: [view, submit_answer, end_session]

        grade_identifier: "my_assignment"
        grade_aggregation_strategy: max_grade

        grading:
        -
            credit_percent: 100
            due: my_assignment_due
            description: "Full credit"

    pages:

    -   ....

Exam
^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* An exam that can be taken at most once in a specified facility.
* Instructors can preview and take the exam from anywhere, at any time,
  as many times as needed.
* No feedback on correctness is provided during the exam.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Midterm exam 1"
    description: |
        # Midterm exam 1

    rules:
        grade_identifier: exam_1
        grade_aggregation_strategy: use_earliest

        -
            if_has_role: [instructor]
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            if_in_facility: "cbtf"
            if_has_role: [student, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 1
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            if_in_facility: "cbtf"
            if_has_role: [student, instructor]
            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: False

        access:
        -
            if_after: end_of_class
            if_has_role: [unenrolled, student]
            permissions: []

        -
            if_in_facility: "cbtf"
            if_has_role: [student, instructor]
            if_after: exam 1 - 1 week
            if_before: end:exam 1 + 2 weeks
            permissions: [view, submit_answer, end_session, cannot_see_flow_result, lock_down_as_exam_session]

        -
            if_has_role: [instructor]
            permissions: [view, submit_answer, end_session, cannot_see_flow_result, lock_down_as_exam_session]

        -
            permissions: []

        grading:
        -   generates_grade: true

    pages:

    -   ....


Pre-Lecture Quiz with Multiple Attempts and Practice Sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* A quiz is due at the start of a lecture.
* After that deadline, the quiz remains available to take
  for half-credit for a week.
* After that week, the quiz will remain available for practice,
  but no attempt will be counted for credit.
* Three for-credit attempts are allowed. Any attempts beyond
  that are simply for practice and not counted for credit.
* Visitors/unenrolled students can view the questions, but not interact with them.
* Feedback on correctness is provided after an answer is submitted.
* The correct answer is revealed after completion.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Quiz: Lecture 13"
    description: |

        # Quiz: Lecture 13

    rules:
        tags:

Homework Set with Grace Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* Homework that is due at a time given by an event ``hw_due 2``.
* Visitors/unenrolled students can view the questions, but not interact with them.
* For-credit sessions are tagged as "full-credit" (``main``) or
  "half-credit" (``grace``) and earn credit correspondingly.
* Students are allowed to decide whether they would like to
  auto-submit their work at the deadline or keep working.
* Due dates are shown as given by ``hw_due 2`` and a week
  after that.
* At the deadlines (or soon after them), an instructor
  "expires" the sessions using a button in the grading interface,
  thereby actually "realizing" the deadline.
* Correct solutions are revealed after the main deadline passes.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Homework 2"
