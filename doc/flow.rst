Flows
=====

.. currentmodule:: course.constants

All interactive content in RELATE is part of a *flow*. Relate uses the made-up
word "flow" to denote an interactive experience that can be any of the
following:

* A quiz
* A few pages of introductory text, combined with some videos
* An exam
* A long-form homework assignment

And possibly many more different things. Technically, a flow consists of
multiple webpages, each of which may allow the participant some type of
interaction, such as submitting answers to questions. All interactions of the
participant with a flow constitute a session. A participant may have multiple
sessions per flow, corresponding to, for example, being able to take the same
quiz multiple times.

This chapter describes how flows are defined from the instructor's perspective.
This consists of two main parts. The first part is defining the interactions
themselves, by providing content for the flow pages. The second consists of
describing what participants are allowed to do, and what grades they are to
receive for their interactions. The system allows tremendous latitude in
defining these rules.

Things that can be decided by flow rules include the following:

* Is student allowed only one or multiple sessions?
* Is the student allowed to review past sessions?
* What are the deadlines involved and how much credit is received for completing a flow?
* Is a participant shown the correct answer and/or the correctness of their
  answer? When are they shown this information? (Right after they submit their
  answer or only after the deadline passes or perhaps right after they have
  submitted their work for grading?)

Overall Structure of a Flow
---------------------------

When described in YAML, a flow has the following components:

.. class:: Flow

    .. attribute:: title

        A plain-text title of the flow

    .. attribute:: description

        A description in :ref:`markup` shown on the start page of the flow.

    .. attribute:: completion_text

        (Optional) Some text in :ref:`markup` shown once a student has
        completed the flow.

    .. attribute:: notify_on_submit

        (Optional) A list of email addresses which to notify about a flow submission by
        a participant.

    .. attribute:: rules

        (Optional) Some rules governing students' use and grading of the flow.
        See :ref:`flow-rules`.

    .. attribute:: groups

        A list of :class:`FlowPageGroup`.  Exactly one of
        :attr:`groups` or :class:`pages` must be given.

    .. attribute:: pages

        A list of :ref:`pages <flow-page>`. If you specify this, a single
        :class:`FlowPageGroup` will be implicitly created. Exactly one of
        :attr:`groups` or :class:`pages` must be given.

An Example
^^^^^^^^^^

Here's a commented example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:
        # Rules that govern when a new session may be started and whether
        # existing sessions may be listed.

        start:
        -
            # Members of the listed roles may start a new session of this
            # flow if they have fewer than 2 existing sessions if the current
            # time is before the event 'end_week 1'.

            if_before: end_week 1
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 2
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            # Otherwise, no new sessions will be allowed,
            # but existing ones may be listed.

            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        # Rules that govern what a user may do with an existing session.
        access:
        -
             # Before the event 'end_week 2', a user may view, submit answers
             # to the flow, and see the grade they received for their answers.

             if_before: end_week 2
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness]

        -
             # Afterwards, they will also be allowed to see the correct answer.
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness, see_answer_after_submission]

        # Rules that govern how (permanent) grades are generated from the
        # results of a flow.

        # Grades for this flow are recorded under grade identifier 'la_quiz'.
        # Multiple such grades (if present) are aggregated by taking their maximum.

        grade_identifier: la_quiz
        grade_aggregation_strategy: max_grade

        grading:
        -
            # If the user completes the flow before the event 'end_week 1', they
            # receive full credit.

            if_completed_before: end_week 1
            credit_percent: 100

        -
            # Otherwise, no credit is given.

.. _flow-permissions:

Access permission bits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: flow_permission

Determining how final (overall) grades of flows are computed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: FlowGradingRules

    Rules that govern how (permanent) grades are generated from the
    results of a flow.

    Found in the ``grading`` attribute of :class:`FlowRules`.

    .. rubric:: Conditions

    .. attribute:: if_has_role

        (Optional) A list of a subset of ``[unenrolled, ta, student, instructor]``.

    .. attribute:: if_has_participation_tags_any

        (Optional) A list of participation tags. Rule applies when the
        participation has at least one tag in this list.

    .. attribute:: if_has_participation_tags_all

        (Optional) A list of participation tags. Rule applies if only the
        participation's tags include all items in this list.

    .. attribute:: if_started_before

        (Optional) A :ref:`datespec <datespec>`. Rule applies if the session was started before
        this time.

    .. attribute:: if_has_tag

        (Optional) Rule applies if session has this tag (see :attr:`FlowStartRules.tag_session`),
        an identifier.

    .. attribute:: if_completed_before

        (Optional) A :ref:`datespec <datespec>`. Rule applies if the session was completed before
        this time.

        When evaluating this condition for in-progress sessions, the current time,
        or, if :attr:`use_last_activity_as_completion_time` is set, the time of the
        last activity is used.

        Since September 2017, this respects :attr:`use_last_activity_as_completion_time`.

    .. rubric:: Rules specified

    .. attribute:: credit_percent

        (Optional) A number indicating the percentage of credit assigned for this flow.
        Defaults to 100 if not present.

    .. attribute:: due

        A :ref:`datespec <datespec>` indicating the due date of the flow. This is shown to the
        participant and also used to batch-expire 'past-due' flows.

    .. attribute:: generates_grade

        (Optional) A Boolean indicating whether a grade will be recorded when this
        flow is ended. Note that the value of this rule must never change over
        the lifetime of a flow. I.e. a flow that, at some point during its lifetime,
        *may* have been set to generate a grade must *always* be set to generate
        a grade. Defaults to ``true``.

    .. attribute:: use_last_activity_as_completion_time

        (Optional) A Boolean indicating whether the last time a participant made
        a change to their flow should be used as the completion time.

        Defaults to ``false`` to match past behavior. ``true`` is probably the more
        sensible value for this.

    .. attribute:: description

        (Optional) A description of this set of grading rules being applied to the flow.
        Shown to the participant on the flow start page.

    .. attribute:: max_points

        (Optional, an integer or floating point number if given)
        The number of points on the flow which constitute
        "100% of the achievable points". If not given, this is automatically
        computed by summing point values from all constituent pages.

        This may be used to 'grade out of N points', where N is a number that
        is lower than the actually achievable count.

    .. attribute:: max_points_enforced_cap

        (Optional, an integer or floating point number if given)
        No participant will have a grade higher than this recorded for this flow.
        This may be used to limit the amount of 'extra credit' achieved beyond
        :attr:`max_points`.

    .. attribute:: bonus_points

        (Optional, an integer or floating point number if given)
        This number of points will be added to every participant's score.

.. autoclass:: grade_aggregation_strategy

.. _flow-page:

Flow pages
----------

.. _flow-groups:

Grouping
^^^^^^^^

Each flow consists of a number of page groups, each of which is made up of
individual :ref:`flow-page`.

The purpose of page groups is to allow shuffling and random selection of
some subset of pages. For example, this functionality would allow you to
have a flow consisting of:

* a fixed introduction page (that is always at the beginning)

* a group of exam questions randomly selected from a bigger pool

* a fixed final page (that may ask the student to, say, affirm academic
  honesty)

Each of these would be a separate 'group'.

Each group allows the following attributes:

.. class:: FlowPageGroup

    .. attribute:: id

        (Required) A symbolic name for the page group.

    .. attribute:: pages

        (Required) A list of :ref:`flow-page`

    .. attribute:: shuffle

        (Optional) A boolean (True/False) indicating whether the order
        of pages should be as in the list :attr:`FlowGroup.pages` or
        determined by random shuffling

    .. attribute:: max_page_count

        (Optional) An integer limiting the page count of this group
        to a certain value. Allows selection of a random subset by combining
        with :attr:`FlowGroup.shuffle`.

.. _page-permissions:

Per-page permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The granted access permissions for the entire flow (see
:class:`FlowAccessRules`) can be modified on a per-page basis.  This happens in
the ``access_rules`` sub-block of each page,
e.g. in :attr:`course.page.ChoiceQuestion.access_rules`:

.. class:: PageAccessRules

    .. attribute:: add_permissions

        A list of :class:`flow_permission` values that are granted *in addition* to
        the globally granted ones.

    .. attribute:: remove_permissions

        A list of :class:`flow_permission` values that are not granted for this page
        even if they are granted by the global flow permissions.

For example, to grant permission to revise an answer on a
:class:`course.page.PythonCodeQuestion`, one might type::

    type: PythonCodeQuestion
    id: addition
    access_rules:
        add_permissions:
            - change_answer
    value: 1

Predefined Page Types
---------------------

.. currentmodule:: course.page

The following page types are predefined:

* :class:`Page` -- a page of static text
* :class:`TextQuestion` -- a page allowing a textual answer
* :class:`SurveyTextQuestion` -- a page allowing an ungraded textual answer
* :class:`HumanGradedTextQuestion` -- a page allowing an textual answer graded by a human
* :class:`InlineMultiQuestion` -- a page allowing answers to be given in-line of a block of text
* :class:`ChoiceQuestion` -- a one-of-multiple-choice question
* :class:`MultipleChoiceQuestion` -- a many-of-multiple-choice question
* :class:`SurveyChoiceQuestion` -- a page allowing an ungraded multiple-choice answer
* :class:`PythonCodeQuestion` -- an autograded code question
* :class:`PythonCodeQuestionWithHumanTextFeedback`
  -- a code question with automatic *and* human grading
* :class:`FileUploadQuestion`
  -- a question allowing a file upload and human grading

.. warning::

    If you change the type of a question, you *must* also change its ID.
    Otherwise, RELATE will assume that existing answer data for this
    question applies to the new question type, and will likely get very
    confused, for one because the answer data found will not be of the
    expected type.

.. |id-page-attr| replace::

    A short identifying name, unique within the page group. Alphanumeric
    with underscores, no spaces.

.. |title-page-attr| replace::

    The page's title, a string. No markup allowed. Required. If not supplied,
    the first ten lines of the page body are searched for a
    Markdown heading (``# My title``) and this heading is used as a title.

.. |access-rules-page-attr| replace::

    Optional. See :ref:`page-permissions`.

.. |value-page-attr| replace::

    An integer or a floating point number, representing the
    point value of the question.

.. |is-optional-page-attr| replace::

    Optional. A Boolean value indicating whether the page is an optional page
    which does not require answer for full completion of the flow.
    If ``true``, :attr:`value` should not present. Defaults to ``false`` if not present.
    Note that ``is_optional_page: true`` differs from ``value: 0`` in that finishing flows
    with unanswered page(s) with the latter will be warned of "unanswered question(s)",
    while with the former won't. When using not-for-grading page(s) to collect
    answers from students, it's to better use ``value: 0``.

.. |text-widget-page-attr| replace::

    Optional.
    One of ``text_input`` (default), ``textarea``, ``editor:MODE``
    (where ``MODE`` is a valid language mode for the CodeMirror editor,
    e.g. ``yaml``, or ``python`` or ``markdown``)

Templated Flows and Forms
-------------------------

Forms provide a web interface for creating flows from a templated flow.
A templated flow is a flow with an extension `.jinja` that has one or more
undefined jinja variables used in it. These undefined jinja variables
are filled using a form submitted by an admin user. When an admin user fills
the fields in the web form, values from the fields are substituted into the
undefined jinja variables in the templated flow and a new flow is created.
This is useful for creating flows without access to the git repository and
also provides a way to create a flow in the during a lecture.

For example, an instructor wants to create a multiple choice question in the
middle of the lecture and have students submit an answer within 10 minutes of
the announcement similar to an i-clicker. Then, a templated flow looks like
the following:


    title: "{{ title }}"

    description: |
        # RELATE Instant Flow

    rules:
        start:
        -
            if_before: end_of_class
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 1
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        access:
        -
            permissions: [view, submit_answer, end_session, see_correctness, see_answer_after_submission]

        grade_identifier: instant_quiz_{{ id }}
        grade_aggregation_strategy: use_latest

        grading:
        -
          if_completed_before: "{{ created_time }} + {{ duration }} minutes"
          credit_percent: 100

        -
          credit_percent: 0

    pages:
      -
        type: ChoiceQuestion
        id: instant_{{ id }}
        title: {{ title }}
        shuffle: True
        prompt: |

          {{ description }}

        choices:
          - {{ choice1 }}
          - {{ choice2 }}
          - {{ choice3 }}

The jinja variables `title, description, choice1, choice2, choice3, duration,
created_time, id` are undefined and needs to be created by the form.
REALTE will fill in `created_time` and `id` and the others need to be fields
in the form. A form must have the fields `template_in`, `template_out`
which correspond to the name of the templted flow and actual flow respectively.
`template_out` will get the timestamp appended to make the file name unique.
A special field `announce` will create an Instant Flow request which will make
the flow visible to all visitors to the course page.

An example form description to create a form that an admin user can submit via
the web interface is as follows. Field types are one of
`Text, Integer, Float, Choice, Hidden`. Hidden fields are not shown to the admin
user, but their default values are substituted in the templated flow.

    fields:
      - id: title
        type: Text
        value: "InClass quiz"
        label: "Title"

      - id: description
        type: Text
        value: ""
        label: "Question"

      - id: duration
        type: Integer
        value: "20"
        label: "Duration in minutes for the flow"

      - id: choice1
        type: Text
        value: "~CORRECT~ (a)"
        label: "Correct choice"

      - id: choice2
        type: Text
        value: "(b)"
        label: "Incorrect choice"

      - id: choice3

        choices:
         - ~DEFAULT~ True
         - False
        label: "Announce to the class"


When the admin user submits the form, a flow will be created using the
values the admin user filled in the web form like the following:

    {% with id="20190930_022148_311577",
            title="InClass quiz",
            description="What's 1 + 1?",
            duration="20",
            choice1="~CORRECT~ 2",
            choice2="1",
            choice3="3",
            template_in="flows/instant_flow.jinja",
            template_out="flows/instant_flow.yml",
            announce="True",
            created_time="2019-09-30 @ 02:21" %}
    {% include "flows/instant_flow.jinja" %}
    {% endwith %}


Sample Rule Sets
----------------

RELATE's rule system is quite flexible and allows many different styles
of interaction. Some of what's possible may not be readily apparent
from the reference documentation above, so the following examples
serve to illustrate the possibilities.

Simple Single-Submission Assignment with a Due Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "An assignment"
    description: |

        # An Assignment

    rules:
        start:
        -
            if_before: my_assignment_due
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 1
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        access:
        -
            # 'modify'-type permissions are automatically removed at
            # session end. Add the following if desired:
            #
            # see_correctness
            # change_answer
            #
            permissions: [view, submit_answer, end_session]

        grade_identifier: "my_assignment"
        grade_aggregation_strategy: max_grade

        grading:
        -
            credit_percent: 100
            due: my_assignment_due
            description: "Full credit"

Exam
^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* An exam that can be taken at most once in a specified facility.
* Instructors can preview and take the exam from anywhere, at any time,
  as many times as needed.
* No feedback on correctness is provided during the exam.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Midterm exam 1"

Pre-Lecture Quiz with Multiple Attempts and Practice Sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* A quiz is due at the start of a lecture.
* After that deadline, the quiz remains available to take
  for half-credit for a week.
* After that week, the quiz will remain available for practice,
  but no attempt will be counted for credit.
* Three for-credit attempts are allowed. Any attempts beyond
  that are simply for practice and not counted for credit.
* Visitors/unenrolled students can view the questions, but not interact with them.
* Feedback on correctness is provided after an answer is submitted.
* The correct answer is revealed after completion.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Quiz: Lecture 13"

Homework Set with Grace Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule set describes the following:

* Homework that is due at a time given by an event ``hw_due 2``.
* Visitors/unenrolled students can view the questions, but not interact with them.
* For-credit sessions are tagged as "full-credit" (``main``) or
  "half-credit" (``grace``) and earn credit correspondingly.
* Students are allowed to decide whether they would like to
  auto-submit their work at the deadline or keep working.
* Due dates are shown as given by ``hw_due 2`` and a week
  after that.
* At the deadlines (or soon after them), an instructor
  "expires" the sessions using a button in the grading interface,
  thereby actually "realizing" the deadline.
* Correct solutions are revealed after the main deadline passes.

The rules for this can be written as follows::

    title: "Homework 2"
