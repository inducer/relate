Rejected ideas
==============

- Minimum visit times
- Live chat via candy?
- configuration store
- Email me my code
- time limits, extra time?
- Restrict analytics to students
  (bad idea: should at least include unenrolled to allow quick in-class work)
- comment box http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8X/2/
- Student tags, adapt homepage
- question bank
  -> localize an elaborate question and all its 'stuff' (JS, media)
  -> use a media search path
