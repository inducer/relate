Ideas
=====

- Make system to link to flow-internal pages

- Note about alternate left/right submission on page sandbox

- Exceptions specific to one session

- Page URL endpoints (see page-url-endpoints branch)

- 'Save and next' for grading

- Fixed grading panel?

- Change "end session" link for sessions that don't actually end.

- Manual grade entry/override

- Flow results analytics
  --> time taken per question

- record end flow with a null page visit

- Flow group ordering, max page count, question/page tags

- Name X out of Y question
- Multi text question
- Multi MC question
- Rank/order question
- TextQuestions with answers yielding different grades

Rejected ideas
==============

- Minimum visit times
- Live chat via candy?
- configuration store
- Email me my code
- time limits, extra time?
- Restrict analytics to students
  (bad idea: should at least include unenrolled to allow quick in-class work)
- comment box http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8X/2/
- Student tags, adapt homepage
- question bank
  -> localize an elaborate question and all its 'stuff' (JS, media)
  -> use a media search path
- web hooks for auto-fetch and auto-preview
