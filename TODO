Ideas
=====

  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_queryset

- Manual grade entry/override

- Flow results analytics
  --> time taken per question

- record end flow with a null page visit

- web hooks for auto-fetch and auto-preview

- Flow group ordering, max page count, question/page tags

- Custom matcher classes

- Name X out of Y question
- Multi text question

Rejected ideas
==============

- Minimum visit times
- Live chat via candy?
- configuration store
- Email me my code
- time limits, extra time?
- Restrict analytics to students
  (bad idea: should at least include unenrolled to allow quick in-class work)
- comment box http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8X/2/
- Student tags, adapt homepage
- question bank
  -> localize an elaborate question and all its 'stuff' (JS, media)
  -> use a media search path
