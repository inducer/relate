RELATE is a web-based courseware package.  It is set apart by the following
features:

* Focus on easy content creation

  * Simple, text-based format for reusable course content
  * Based on standard `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_,
    `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_

  See `example content <https://github.com/inducer/relate-sample>`_.

* Flexible rules for participation, access, and grading

* Code questions:

  * Allow students to write code into a text box (with syntax highlighting)
  * Sandboxed execution
  * Automatic grading
  * Plotting support
