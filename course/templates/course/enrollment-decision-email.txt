We're sorry to let you know that your request to join the course 
'{{course_identifier}}' has been denied. Please get in touch with the course
staff (for example by replying to this email) to state your case.

One common reason for this may be that you may have used your personal email
(such as a GMail or Yahoo account) rather than your official university account
to sign in. If that is the case, please use the official account and
try again.{% endblocktrans %}
